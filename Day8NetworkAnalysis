FINGERPRINTING AND HOST IDENTIFICATION
	Variances in the RFC implementation for different OSâ€™s and systems enables the capability for fingerprinting
	Tools used for fingerprinting and host identification can be used passively(sniffing/fingerprinting) or actively(scanning)
P0F (PASSIVE OS FINGERPRINTING)
	Looks at variations in initial TTL, fragmentation flag, default IP header packet length, window size, and TCP options
	Configuration stored in:
		/etc/p0f/p0f.fp
NETWORK TRAFFIC SNIFFING
	What makes traffic capture possible?
		Libpcap
		WinPcap (outdated)
		NPCAP
NETWORK TRAFFIC BASELINING
	Snapshot of what the network looks like during a time frame
	No industry standard
	7 days to establish the initial snapshot
	Prerequisite Information
NETWORK BASELINE OBJECTIVE
	Determines the current state of your network
	Ascertain the current utilization of network resources
	Identify normal vs peak network traffic time frames
	Verify port / protocol usage
ANALYZE NETWORK TRAFFIC STATISTICS
	Protocol Hierarchy
	Conversations
	Endpoints
	I/O Graph
	IPv4 and IPv6 Statistics
	Expert Information
TCPDUMP
