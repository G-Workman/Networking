RECONNAISSANCE
	Active
	Passive
		Gathering information about targets without direct interaction
		Not as straight forward and requires more time than active reconnaissance
		Lower risk of discovery
		Involves identifying:
			IP addresses and Sub-Domains
			External and 3rd party sites
			People and Technologies
			Content of Interest
			Vulnerabilities
		Possible tools for gathering:
			WHOIS queries
			Job site listings
			Phone Numbers
			Google searches
			Passive OS fingerprinting

	External
	
PASSIVE EXTERNAL NETWORK RECONNAISSANCE
	Information gathered outside of the network using passive methods
	Allows for more efficient attacks and plans
	DNS:
		Resolves hostnames to IP addresses
		RFC 3912
		WHOIS queries
	DIG:
		Typically between primary and secondary DNS servers
		If allowed to transfer externally hostnames, IPs, and IP blocks can be determined
		dig axfr
	ZONE TRANSFERS:
		Returns DNS information
		Supplements base queries
	HOST HISTORY:
		netcraft
		wayback machine
	GOOGLE SEARCHES:
		subdomains
		technologies
	SHODAN:
		Reveals information about technologies, remote access services, improperly configured services, and network infrastructure.
		When selected can give additional information and applicable vulnerabilities
NETWORK SCANNING:
	Scanning Strategy
	Remote to Local
