RECONNAISSANCE
	Active
	Passive
		Gathering information about targets without direct interaction
		Not as straight forward and requires more time than active reconnaissance
		Lower risk of discovery
		Involves identifying:
			IP addresses and Sub-Domains
			External and 3rd party sites
			People and Technologies
			Content of Interest
			Vulnerabilities
		Possible tools for gathering:
			WHOIS queries
			Job site listings
			Phone Numbers
			Google searches
			Passive OS fingerprinting
	Internal
	External
	
PASSIVE EXTERNAL NETWORK RECONNAISSANCE
	Information gathered outside of the network using passive methods
	Allows for more efficient attacks and plans
	DNS:
		Resolves hostnames to IP addresses
		RFC 3912
		WHOIS queries
	DIG:
		Typically between primary and secondary DNS servers
		If allowed to transfer externally hostnames, IPs, and IP blocks can be determined
		dig axfr
	ZONE TRANSFERS:
		Returns DNS information
		Supplements base queries
	HOST HISTORY:
		netcraft
		wayback machine
	GOOGLE SEARCHES:
		subdomains
		technologies
	SHODAN:
		Reveals information about technologies, remote access services, improperly configured services, and network infrastructure.
		When selected can give additional information and applicable vulnerabilities
NETWORK SCANNING:
	Scanning Strategy
	Remote to Local
	Local to Remote
	Local to Local
	Remote to Remote
	
	Scanning Approach
		Aim
			Wide range target scan
			Target specific scan
		Method
			Single source scan
			Distributed scan
			
	Broadcast Ping and Ping sweep

	ARP scan
	SYN scan
	Full connect scan
	Null scan
	FIN scan
	XMAS tree scan
	UDP scan
	ACK/Window scan
	RPC scan
	FTP scan
	decoy scan
	OS fingerprinting scan
	version scan
	Protocol ping
	Discovery probes
	
	nmap [Options] [Target IP/ Subnet]
	nc [Options] [Target IP] [Target Port]

CLI Ninja Ping Sweep:
	for i in {1..254} ;do (ping -c 1 192.168.1.$i | grep "bytes from" &) ;done
curl cht.sh/nc
netstat -ntlp		#listening ports
netstat -altp		#established ports
ps -elf			#see all things that are running

nmap 10.10.0.40/27 -v -Pn -T5 -p 20-25,80
			    			  -p-
							  
ONCE IN A ROUTER
	show config
	show int
	
Post nmap scan
	wget -r ip:21
	wget -r ftp://ip
