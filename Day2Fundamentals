Layer 3 - IP + IPv6
	The network layer receives the segment and creates a packet by encapsulating the TCP header and data payload in an IP header.
	The correct IP information is added to the header for the destination IP address.
	The packet is then passed down to the Data-Link layer.
Layer 4 - TCP/UDP
	is responsible for the transfer of data, ensuring that data is error-free and in order.
	Transport layer communication falls under two categories:
		Connection-oriented (TCP-Segments-Unicast traffic)
			requires that a connection with specific agreed-upon parameters be established before data is sent.
			provides segmentation and sequencing.
			provides connection establishment and acknowledgments.
			provides flow control (or windowing).
			Identify common application layer protocols or functions that rely on TCP.
			Get more information in RFC 793
	Connection-less (UDP-Datagrams-Broadcast, Multicast, Unicast Traffic)
		requires no connection before data is sent
		provides no ordering, duplicate protection or delivery guarantee
		does provide integrity checking
		Identify common application layer protocols or functions that rely on UDP
Layer 5 Session Layer
	Session Layer — The main purpose of this layer is to maintain the state of your ongoing connections.
		This state is not used in a connection-less protocol.
		This layer provides the capabilities to open, close and manage sessions between the application layer processes.
		The communication at this layer consist of requests and responses that occur between the local and remote applications.
		Session-layer makes use of remote procedure calls (RPCs), Net-Beui, SOCKS, SMB, WINS, named-pipes, PPTP and other protocols.
	Socks 4/5
		Initiates connections through a proxy
		Uses various Client / Server exchange messages
		Client can provide authentication to server
		Client can request connections from server
	Allowed devices to establish connections to other devices on network to share files, printers and other things.
		SMB Rides over Netbios - allows applications to communicate over a LAN using a NetBIOS name. Depricated due to DNS. Netbios Wiki
		Netbios Dgram Service - UDP 138
		Netbios Session Service - TCP 139
Layer 6 Presentation Layer
	Presentation Layer — This layer deals with the Translating, Formatting, Encryption, and Compression of data.
	Translation-The presentation layer is responsible for interoperability between encoding methods as different computers use different encoding methods
		It translates data between the formats the network requires and the format at the computer.
		Formatting - This layer is responsible to put the file in a format that is readable. Such as:
			ASCII or EBCDIC
			.doc, .ppt or .xls
			mp3 or wav
			avi or mp4
			bmp, jpeg, gif, tiff or png
		Encryption This is the layer the encryption and decryption gets carried out.
			Symetric: AES, Blowfish, Twofish, DES, and RC4
			Asymetric: PKI, Deffie-Hellman, DSS, RSA, Elliptic curve
		Compression Sometimes data gets to big to transmit over the network so The Presentation layer handles compression.
		The primary role of Data compression is to reduce the number of bits to be transmitted.
		It is important in transmitting multimedia such as audio, video, text etc.
			Zip, TAR, RAR, 7zip, CAB
Layer 7 Application Layer
FTP (TCP 20/21):
	File Transfer Protocol is a standard network protocol that is used for file transfer between a client and a server.
	Authentication is performed via a username and password, but can also be disabled in favor of anonymous mode if the FTP server is configured for it.
	The drawback with FTP is that all communication is clear text, including the initial authentication.
	ACTIVE:
		A client initiates a connection with a server on port 21 from the client’s ephemeral high port. 
		The three way handshake is completed and the client listens on it’s ephemeral high port + 1, 
		the client sends the port N+1 command to the server on port 21 (control port). 
		Ex: if the command to the server is from ephemeral port 1026, it would listen on port 1027. 
		the server initiates a connection to the client’s ephemeral high (1027) from the server’s data port (20) and the data is transferred.
	PASSIVE:
		Passive FTP sidesteps the issue of Active mode by reversing the conversation.
		The client initiates both the command and data connections.
SSH (TCP 22):
	SSH was initially created to replace insecure rsh suite of Unix programs. The syntax and user interface is identical.
	Capabilities were expanded to replace FTP and RCP (remote copy protocol) with SFTP and SCP respectively.
	Server-Client Relationship
	Connection based
	USER + HOST keys - asymmetric
	Session key - symmetric

Berkley Packet Filter (BPFs)
	a way for filtering packets from kernel to userspace.
	full access to packet
	
	tcpdump {A} [B:C] {D} {E} {F} {G}

	A = Protocol (ether | arp | ip | ip6 | icmp | tcp | udp)
	B = Header Byte offset
	C = optional: Byte Length. Can be 1, 2 or 4 (default 1)
	D = optional: Bitwise mask (&)
	E = Operator (= | == | > | < | <= | >= | != | () | << | >>)
	F = Result of Expresion
	G = optional: Logical Operator (&& ||) to bridge expressions
	
	Example using tcpdump:
		tcpdump 'ether[12:2] = 0x0800 && (tcp[2:2] != 22 && tcp[2:2] != 23)'
		
	To filter down to the bit(s) and not just the byte.
		ip[0] & 0x0F > 0x05
		
	FILTER LOGIC - MOST EXCLUSIVE
		All designated bit values must be set; no others can be set
			tcp[13] = 0x11
			--or--
			tcp[13] & 0xFF = 0x11

	FILTER LOGIC - LESS EXCLUSIVE
		All designated bits must be set; all others may be set
			tcp[13] & 0x11 = 0x11
	
	FILTER LOGIC - LEAST EXCLUSIVE
		At least one of the designated bits must be set to not equal 0; all others may be set
			tcp[13] & 0x11 !=0
