1 bit   = bit/flag
4 bits  = nibble
8 bits  = byte
16 bits = half word
32 bits = word
64 bits = very long word

Base 2  = binary
base 10 = decimal
base 16 = hex
base 64 = encoder (==)

encapsulation = header + tail; a wrapper around data

PHYSICAL LAYER RESPONSIBILITIES
    Hardware Specifications
    Encoding and Signaling
    Data Transmission and Reception

Organizations
    IETF - organizations that set standards
    IANA - used for assigning Domain Names, IP's, etc.
    IEEE - hardware standards
	
DATA LINK SUB-LAYERS
	MAC (Media Access Control)
		Act as a sublayer governing protocol
		access to the physical medium, physical addressing, and acts as an interface between the LLC and physical layer
		Most of the frame construction happens at this layer.
	LLC (Logical Link Control)
		Manages communication between devices over a single link of the network that includes error checking and data flow.
		This layer provides the Ethertype to the MAC sublayer in the frame construction to identify the encapsulated protocol.
	Type 2 Frame
		Header
			First 6 bytes - DMAC
			Next 6 bytes - SMAC
			Last 2 bytes - ethertype
				Common Ethertypes controlled by IANA.org:
					0x0800 - IPv4
					0x0806 - ARP
					0x86DD - IPv6
					0x8100 - VLAN Tagging 802.1q
	802.1Q Header
		MAC Header (12 byte field)
			First 6 bytes - DMAC
			Next 6 bytes - SMAC
		VLAN Tag (4 byte field)
			Tag Protocol ID (2 byte field)
				Initial 2 bytes contain the new effective Ethertype field of 0x8100 indicating tagging
			Tag Control Information (2 byte field)
				Priority Code Point (3 bits)
				Drop Eligible Indicator (1 bit)
		VLAN ID (12 bit field)
	Ethertype (2 byte field)
		Used to indicate the next protocol encapsulated in the frame.
	
	ARP Header
		ARP 
			To resolve the L2 (MAC) address when only the L3 (IPv4) address is known.
		RARP 
			To resolve the L3 (IPv4) address when only the L2 (MAC) is known.
			(This protocol has been deprecated since the widespread use of protocols like BOOTP and DHCP.)

		Proxy ARP - A device (router) answers the ARP queries for IP address that is on a different network.
					The ARP proxy see the ARP request and determines that the target Network address is not on the local network segment and
						is aware of how to reach the destination network.
					The proxy will offer its own MAC address in response to the request.
					Typically this device is the network gateway and is responsible to forward traffic for other networks.

		ARP Cache - Is a collection of Layer 2 to Layer 3 address mappings discovered utilizing the ARP request/response process.
					When a host needs to send a packet both the L2 and L3 addresses are needed.
					The host will look in this table to determine if it already knows both the L2 and L3 addresses.
					If the target is not in the table then a ARP request is initiated.
					The ARP cache can be populated statically but mostly its done dynamically.
					This cache can be exploited by attackers with the aim to poison the cache with incorrect information to either perform a DoS or MitM.
